1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly
statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?
Comparing the different assembly stats across kmer values 31, 41, and 49, we saw the following trends:
-N50 increased as kmer size increase
-Mean contig length increase as kmer size increase
-Length of contig decreases as kmer size increases
-Number of contigs decreases dramatically as kmer size increases
-Mean depth stays relevatively the same, give or take 5.

2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening to the
de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does velvet
calculate its value for ‘auto’?
We observe that by increasing the coverage cutoff between 20x and 60 at kmer size 49 as followed:
-N50 increased, however not by a lot
-Mean contig stays about the same
-Max contig decreases
-length of genome decreases
-Number of contigs decreases dramatically
-Mean depth coverage almost doubles between 20x and 60x

Using the auto option: The coverage cutoff can also be set automatically to half the length weighted
median contig coverage depth.

Changing the paramaters changes the amount of paths in the De Brujn Graph. 

3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and
N50?
When comparing the auto contig length and the 500bp contig length, we see the following trends:
-N50 increases as contig length increases
-We saw a high frequency in the 100s buckets in the auto contig length
-We saw a high frequency in the 1000s buckets in the 500bp contig length.
